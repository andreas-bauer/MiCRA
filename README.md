# Multi-label Classification of Requirements Artifacts (MiCRA)

A tool to demonstrate the multi-label classification of requirements artifacts, and its application.


## How to Develop

The project consist of two main parts, a backend and a frontend. In order to start development you need to bring up the backend and the frontend.

### Backend

Ensure that you have python `v 3.9` installed on your machine. 

1. Navigate to the `./backend/` folder using the terminal.
2. Create an copy of the environment file by running `cp .env.example .env`.
3. Install backend dependencies by running the command `pip install -r requirements.txt`. You should run this command evertime you pull the code from the repository and whenever you change the requirements file.
4. Start the server `python server.py`.


### Frontend

Ensure that you have at least npm `v 10.3.0`.

1. Navigate to the `./frontend/` folder using the terminal.
2. Create an copy of the environment file by running `cp .env.example .env`.
3. Install frontend dependencies by running the command `npm install`.
4. Start the frontend development server by running `npm start`.
